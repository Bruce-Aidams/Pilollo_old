1. IMPROVING THE CART
		currently when an item is added to the cart the request sends the buyer to a new page (mycart)
		which lists down all products in the cart. I thought with the use of AJAX and some javascript 
		we can create a modal of sort which pops up onto the page anytime a product is added to the cart.

2. Integrate the frontend to the back 

3. Add a "follow saller" function that allows buyers who wish to buy from a particular shop to get notifications if they 		enlist a products

4. The wishlist function
